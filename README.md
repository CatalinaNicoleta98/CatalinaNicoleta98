## Hi there, I'm Catalina 👋

I'm a **bachelor’s student in web development** with a strong interest in building structured, maintainable, and user-focused solutions.  
I work across both **front-end and back-end development**, enjoying the balance between clean interfaces, solid logic, and well-structured data.

I care about writing clear, reliable code and understanding how different parts of an application work together.
